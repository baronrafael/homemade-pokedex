## To meet the fair use requirements of the Pok√©API, all http requests must be cached. For this we have written an RXJS operator

```
getAllPkmns() {
    return this.http
      .get<ListQueryResponse<PokemonListQueryResponse>>(this.getAllpkmnsUrl)
      .pipe(
        map((resp) => {
          return resp.results;
        }),
        cacheResult(),
      );
  }
```
